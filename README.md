## Problem Statement
The Steam platformis currently the largest PC game online distributor in the world, and has accumulated a vast amount of player and game data.
The purpose of this project is to use regression models to predict the average total play time of based on the information about the game that is available on Steam.

Customer engagement is a measurement of a user's response to the product. By prediciting STEAM video games and user engagement with a predicitive model, I hope to improve user experience and customer engagement to contribute to the success of video games on STEAM.
